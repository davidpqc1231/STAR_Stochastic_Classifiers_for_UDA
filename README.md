# Stochastic Classifiers for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CVPR2020)

## Introduction

This is the implementation for STAR (STochastic clAssifieRs). The main idea for that is to build a distribution over the weights of the classifiers. With that, infinite number of classifiers can be sampled without extra parameters.
